V1 of Student Scholar - a social networking site where students can connect with each other, message each other, have classroom discussions, and post to their school forums. Initial beta test website: https://student-scholar-beta.appspot.com
Final website: http://studentscholar.org
V1 competed in the 2018 Congressional App Challenge.
V2 is coming soon, and will be completely programmed, designed, and built by my friend Adi Bhujle.
