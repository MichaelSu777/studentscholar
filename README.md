V1 of Student Scholar - a social networking site where students can connect with each other, message each other, have classroom discussions, and post to their school forums. Initial beta test website: https://student-scholar-beta.appspot.com
Final website: http://studentscholar.org
V1 competed in the 2018 Congressional App Challenge, and served as a great learning experience for me and my friend Adi Bhujle.

Adi designed and created the entire frontend which consists of advanced design features such as Parallax design, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, and dynamic UI/UX components. I created and designed the backend which included a real-time messaging system, a forum post system, a registration system, and a website search engine. 

V2 is coming soon, and will be completely programmed, designed, and built by my friend Adi Bhujle.
